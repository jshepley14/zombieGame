Game Objective: 
The objective of the game is to stay alive for as long as possible and kill as many zombies as you can.   The zombies will start to head in random directions on the screen and at different speeds.  After the player gets to level three, larger zombies will start to walk toward the player. If the main player touches a zombie for too long, he will die.  Press the spacebar to start a new game once you have died.  The main character has a several guns that he can use to fire bullets at the zombies to make them die and disappear off the screen.  The more zombies killed, the higher the score.   Some zombies are harder to kill, but are worth more points.  Different guns have different damage and different firing rates.   The player has a limited amount of ammo, so the player will have to either switch guns or pick up more ammo packages, which appear when a zombie is killed.  The player has a limited health, but can recover health by picking up health care packages.   As time goes on, there will be more and more zombies.  Your score is saved in the top left corner of the screen.
